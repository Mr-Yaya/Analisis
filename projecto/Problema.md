#K eismo elemento (Selection algorithm)


##The goal
The problems is that we want to to find a element that is scrictly superior of inferior than k elements, in a data scrutures of n elements.
To acheive this goal we need to supose that the data can be ordenated.

## Solutions

We will implement the Quicksort algoritme and try to upgrade it.

## Comparaison of the differents data strucutures

## Complexity

## Algorithm proof
